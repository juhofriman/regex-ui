# regex-ui
Regular expressions are essential. Unfortunately, one does not need them daily (at least I don't), so every single time I end up googling how did regexes work. From now on, I don't have to. I also wanted to try out something simple with angular 2, so this is what came out.

Deploys automagically from travis to: http://juhofriman.github.io/regex-ui/

It is at really early stage and still lacks support for capturing groups and various "regex modes".
